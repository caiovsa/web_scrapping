## Amazon web scraping

> This Data science project is very simple and is about scraping a web page to get any relevant data. In this project i decided to scrap some products on amazon.

> The project consists of getting the price and some other features of any product just by using the link (not all pages work in it) and save it in a .csv file so I can check it without needing to use the notebook again.

> I created another file just for the sake of curiosity (this one is a .py file, not a notebook) where I preselect some products (mainly games), and each time I run it, it gets the price of the products and saves it on a .csv file with the time stamp, so I can check the price variation on these games.
